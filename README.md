# Mercuriya star

This star will serve as a donation button on the Mercuriya website. The concept was initially suggested by the brand creators, but it took me several years to find the right tool, namely `framer-motion`, to implement it in a manner that aligns with my preferences.

I'm currently experimenting with various concepts during my free time, so memorization in this case seems unnecessary. Despite CPU debouncing, the tail animation will maintain its smoothness. The intention behind this was to explore and gain a better understanding of how memoizing affects animation performance and how much space it could give in terms of computation complexity.
